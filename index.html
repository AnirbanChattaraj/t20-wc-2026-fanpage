    <section>
      <h2>Cricket: Legacy, Culture & Global Impact</h2>

      <p>
        Cricket is not just a sport — it is a legacy passed across generations.
        From its traditional roots to the modern T20 revolution, cricket has
        continuously evolved while preserving its values of discipline,
        strategy, and sportsmanship.
      </p>

      <p>
        The introduction of T20 cricket reshaped the global cricketing
        landscape. Faster matches, high-intensity moments, and wider global
        reach transformed cricket into an inclusive and commercially powerful
        sport.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nations such as India, England, Australia, and the West Indies have
        defined different eras of dominance, while associate nations now have
        opportunities to compete and grow on the world stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hosting the ICC T20 World Cup 2026 places India and Sri Lanka at the
        center of global cricket once again — combining passion, history, and
        unmatched fan engagement.
      </p>

      <p><strong>
        As the world gathers in 2026, cricket stands as a unifying force,
        blending tradition, innovation, and the dreams of millions.
      </strong></p>

  <h2>Fans, Emotions & Match-Day Rituals</h2>

  <p>
    For cricket fans, a match day is not just another day on the calendar.
    Jerseys are worn with pride, superstitions are followed without question,
    and every ball feels personal. From early-morning alarms to last-over
    nail-biters, fans live every moment with the team.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many fans have their own rituals — sitting in the same spot, avoiding
    certain conversations during tense overs, or watching matches with the
    same group of people year after year. These rituals create a deep emotional
    bond that goes far beyond the scoreboard.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Stadium Chants & Crowd Energy</h2>

  <p>
    Indian stadiums are known for their electrifying atmosphere. The roar of
    the crowd, synchronized claps, and chants of “India! India!” or
    “Sachin! Sachin!” have turned stadiums into fortresses over the years.
  </p>

  <p>
    During high-pressure moments, the crowd often becomes the twelfth player.
    A single boundary can lift an entire stadium, while a wicket can silence
    thousands — proving how deeply fans are emotionally invested in the game.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Iconic Fan Memories</h2>

  <p>
    Every cricket fan remembers exactly where they were during iconic moments —
    the 2007 T20 World Cup win, the unforgettable victories under lights, and
    celebrations that spilled onto streets across the country.
  </p>

  <p>
    These moments are shared across generations. Parents introduce their
    children to the game, stories are retold every World Cup, and legends live
    on not just in record books, but in fan conversations and emotions.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Team India Feels Personal</h2>

  <p>
    Supporting Team India is not just about winning trophies — it is about
    identity, pride, and collective emotion. Victories feel like national
    celebrations, while defeats are felt deeply across millions of hearts.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pursuit of a third T20 World Cup title in 2026 represents more than
    history. It represents belief, resilience, and the dreams of fans who
    continue to support the team through every high and low.
  </p>

  <p><strong>
    For Indian fans, cricket is not watched — it is lived.
